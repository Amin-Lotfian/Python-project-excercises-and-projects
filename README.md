## Python Data analytics course
Completed a comprehensive [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8) in Python programming with a strong focus on data analytics. Developed skills in core Python concepts, including classes, functions, loops, and list comprehensions, which enabled me to write efficient and reusable code. Worked extensively with key libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, transformation, and merging to prepare and manipulate datasets for analysis.

Gained experience in data visualization using Matplotlib and seaborn for creating clear and effective visual representations of data insights. As part of the course, I completed five detailed projects, each involving data extraction, preparation, and in-depth analysis of real-world datasets. This hands-on experience strengthened my ability to derive meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.
